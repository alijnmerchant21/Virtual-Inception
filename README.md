Title: Virtual Inception.


Details: In this project we are using VR to create an application which can aid in designing a sample flat. When designing a sample flat, we have to imagine how the things will be placed or look like. The application is to be designed for mobile devices or tablets working on Android platform. Virtual reality (VR) is a live, direct or indirect, view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are Virtual (or supplemented) by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, graphics or accelerometer data. It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented), by a computer. As a result, the technology functions by enhancing oneâ€™s current perception of reality. By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one. Virtualization is conventionally in real-time and in semantic context with environmental elements. Artificial information about the environment and its objects can be overlaid on the real world. This is an application which allows users of Android smartphones to visualize a room with furniture which shows length of the wall on wall focus. The screen will split into two screens to facilitate 3D view through Google Cardboard. Audio will play on app background.
